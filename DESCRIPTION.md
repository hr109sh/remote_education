# TeacherAssist - Amplifying Learning

Covid-19 pandemic caused the education to move online. Teachers and students are facing a lot of challenges. In a class of roughly 30-40 students monitoring each one using media devices is not easy. One of the major challenges we identified is that the attention span of the students is on a decline, which in turn reduces their effectiveness. Teacher is no control. To address this issue, we moved back to the physical classrooms, where the same problem does exist. When a teacher feels a student is not paying attention, she would buzz the student by asking a question! 

This is what TeacherAssist does.

## The Idea

TeacherAssist prompts questions to students at regular intervals. These intervals correspond to their attention span. The max duration is 15minutes which is less than the TED benchmark. These questions are pre-loaded by the teacher relevant to the given topic. Based on the response, we capture the student’s attentiveness and effectiveness. 

Attentiveness is the time taken by the student to respond to a question. Effectiveness is the accuracy of the response. 

### Solution

TeacherAssist provides a platform where the teachers and students can collaborate over meetings. The teacher is provided with a detailed dashboard and a mini dashboard. The detailed dashboard shows the data for all her sessions. Mini dashboard shows the attendance, attentiveness, and effectiveness real-time during the session. Based on this knowledge the teacher has the capability to alter her content and get the student to focus. 

### Why TeacherAssist

TeacherAssist has a simple UI which can be used by any non-techie teacher or student. We ensure the privacy of the student is not intruded. Attentiveness is not tracked by tracking keystrokes or windows overlays. We use a positive approach to solve a known problem.

## Scope

TeacherAssist can be used as a regular assessment tool and to track the performance of the students. This is also be used to track the effectiveness of the teachers based on the parameters derived from the student data. As a future scope views can be provided to parents, school management, school administration, vendors, and government. It can be a comprehensive tool to deliver targeted content.

Scope for the solution is not just limited to education. It can be used in Project Management, Corporate Training, Conferences, etc. 

### Vision

Our vision is “Build and effective learning environment for happy students.”
